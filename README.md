# QUANTIFIEDself Front-end
QUANTIFIEDself is a web application that tracks food with calories, and four different meals with foods.  A typical day is calculated to include 2000 calories, and each food eaten in a meal will subtract its corresponding calories from this total count.  You can also select different foods and view recipes that utilize these ingredients, powered by the Yummly API.
